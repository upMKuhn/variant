# Requirements

The library requires a standard conformant implementation of **C++11**; a few additional features are only available under **C++14**. Some effort was done to support incomplete language or standard library implementations &mdash;see [Config](http://eggs-cpp.github.io/variant/config.html "Config - Eggs.Variant")&mdash;. There are no external dependencies.

The library is continuously tested with the following configurations:
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eggs-cpp/variant.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eggs-cpp/variant)
[![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/eggs-cpp/variant?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/K-ballo/variant)

 - _Clang_ 3.8, 3.9, 4.0
 - _GCC_ 4.9, 5, 6
 - _Apple LLVM_ 7.3, 8.3
 - _MSVC_ 2015, 2017

_[Note:_ Older versions of _Clang_ (3.0+) and _GCC_ (4.6+) are no longer tested,
but should still work; please report any issues if you are using them. Older
versions of _MSVC_ are not supported._]_
